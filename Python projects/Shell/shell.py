    An todos-list app, and integrated login system that i tried to make through tkinter but made this todos app through the basic python... 
    Hello Coders!,
        This project is not complete yet!... I've made this a shell where you can execute the commands that are valid, my first attempt to made a app like this..! that is a shell, you can add the todos by using the commands
        as i said earlier that this project isn't complete yet!, but i try this project to complete as soon as possible... I shall also try to make a GUI of this!, using Tkinter.. but later on!... any contributions are always Welcome 🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂
